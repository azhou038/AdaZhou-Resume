        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ada Zhou and I am currently an undergradute student at the University of California, Riverside studying business. I look forward to concentrating in accounting and marketing. I have great interpersonal skills, having the ability to work alone and with others. Working with online applications is my specialty as I have a lot of experience with computers, from knowing how to write codes to creating graphics with photoshop. I worked in customer service as a server at a restaurant so I am experienced with the P.O.S system and communicating with customers. To compensate for skills that I may lack in I would contribute huge amounts of time in hopes of improving them. <br><br>

        Back in Alhambra, California, I interned for a local church which not only allowed me to improve my communication skills among my team members but also allowed me to explore my creative side. During my time there, I created graphics for events the church is hosting. By carrying this responsibility, I was taught to manage my time well, balancing both my internship and academics. While designing graphics, I experienced multiple creative blocks, which taught to me take time back, and patiently brainstorm ideas and take suggestions from my team members into consideration. I have learned that working with others means that I am not alone and that my ideas are not the only one that matters. Rather than having one mind working on projects, I have multiple minds that are the host of many creative aspects. I have learned that working with others comes respect from not only them but for them. Although I may have not had a positive relationship with a hundred percent of my co-workers, I learned to put our differences aside and to tackle the assignment at hand. The internship taught me that working with a group is more than just a distributed workload, but the combination of many different minds working together and creating amazing projects.<br><br>

        My passion for accounting allowed me to develop my intrapersonal skills. Taking the class earlier on in school, I was often alone working on projects instead of the traditional group projects. I have become accustomed to concepts such as general journals, balance sheets, and excel as I was told to learn them and worked with them on many projects. I have learned that accounting requires concentration, which taught me to not only focus on the task at hand but to look over my work to check for miscalculations or mistakes that can jeopardize the whole document. Being patient is a skill that I can not only apply to work by myself but as a group as well. I understand that in the future, I may not agree with everyone's ideas, but I should be patient and open-minded.
